- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alessiapetracin
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in machine learning and statistical analysis applied to social phenomena, business and economics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Data Science, minoring in business. I have an unusual international relations and economics background because of my interest in social sciences,
  but I decided to pursue a more analytical academic path, since I'm looking to analyze social dynamics from a more statistical perspective.
